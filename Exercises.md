## Week 1 ~ Questions

**What do you think digital writing is?**
- E-Lit/Digital Writing (DW) Digital challenges the common print and scholarly conventions of literature and hybridises
  literary forms to exist within an online space. At it's most basic level, DW must exist in an online space and must 
  also be defined as literature by it's author and/or its critical reader.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**
- I expect to be analysing online works of DW and to be exposed to a variety of very different literature forms that
  I may have never come across previously. I also expect to be creating some DW with the help and guidance of the
  tutor, and this will probably include coding in some form.
  
**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
- Poetry and short-form non-fiction, often in a combined hybrid form.

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
- Word, WordPress, PowerPoint, the notes app on my phone.

**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
- Word is easy to use because it is familiar.
- PowerPoint – I’ve wanted to publish a poetry since I was in year 9 so PowerPoint is mainly used as a way to imagine
  that coming true in a physical way. It is also good for categorising the poetry, for example: I can have one slide 
  that just has the heading 2017-2018, and then all the poetry I wrote in those years will come after that slide, and 
  so on and so forth.
- WordPress I use because it is relevant to the industry. It’s the platform I use for my website.
- The notes app on my phone because it’s on hand at all times.

**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
- Word is constraining when it comes to incorporating photography into my pieces, just layout-wise it looks pretty
  plain and uninteresting to have a photo on a white document with some text next to it. Otherwise, it's very good for
  lone text pieces.
- PowerPoint I use as a kind of folio to put my poetry in. I use it as a way to imagine my writing in a printed book.
  It also makes it easy to organise my poetry into sections and to skim through all my work.
- Notes app is always available so it allows me to capture some of the more fleeting prose and poetry that comes while on
  the go. Other than that I don't use it for writing.


  ## Week 3 ~ Questions & Coding

**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**
*Taroko Gorge*
- Taroko Gorge is (i think) an AI generated, never-ending poem. It presents as lines of poetry that move upwards, each new line
  pulling itself out of a green ether every second or so. Because it is text based and not interactable as far as I can tell, I
  would say all elements of this DW piece are readable.

*The Gathering Cloud*
- The Gathering Cloud (from my interpretation) is a visual and written poetry piece about climate change and the online world.
  It has elements of readable text within it, usually small poetry pieces that lay disconnected with one another on the webpage,
  which also contain hyperlinks that give you addition information and alternative meanings for words used in the poem. Each
  'section' of The Gathering Cloud holds a written name - '[Frontispiece.]' '[No. 1.]' '[No. 2.]' '[No. 3.]' '[No. 4.]'
  '[No. 5.]' and '[SOURCES]', and even some of the moving & static visuals have written components to them (e.g. '[Frontispiece.]').
  

**How are those elements meaningful?**
- 

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**
- 

**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**
-

**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**
-
