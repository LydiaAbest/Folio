## Week 1 ~ Questions

**What do you think digital writing is?**
- E-Lit/Digital Writing (DW) Digital challenges the common print and scholarly conventions of literature and hybridises
  literary forms to exist within an online space. At it's most basic level, DW must exist in an online space and must 
  also be defined as literature by it's author and/or its critical reader.

**What do you expect from the digital writing lab?**
- I expect to be analysing online works of DW and to be exposed to a variety of very different literature forms that
  I may have never come across previously. I also expect to be creating some DW with the help and guidance of the
  tutor, and this will probably include coding in some form.
  
**What types of writing do you do (e.g. fiction, nonfiction, poetry)?**
- Poetry and short-form non-fiction, often in a combined hybrid form.

**What tools (or techniques) do you use to write?**
- Word, WordPress, PowerPoint, the notes app on my phone.

**Why do you use these tools (or techniques)?**
- Word is easy to use because it is familiar.
- PowerPoint – I’ve wanted to publish a poetry since I was in year 9 so PowerPoint is mainly used as a way to imagine
  that coming true in a physical way. It is also good for categorising the poetry, for example: I can have one slide 
  that just has the heading 2017-2018, and then all the poetry I wrote in those years will come after that slide, and 
  so on and so forth.
- WordPress I use because it is relevant to the industry. It’s the platform I use for my website.
- The notes app on my phone because it’s on hand at all times.

**How do these tools shape the way you write (e.g., constrain the way you write or facilitate your writing)?**
- Word is constraining when it comes to incorporating photography into my pieces, just layout-wise it looks pretty
  plain and uninteresting to have a photo on a white document with some text next to it. Otherwise, it's very good for
  lone text pieces.
- PowerPoint I use as a kind of folio to put my poetry in. I use it as a way to imagine my writing in a printed book.
  It also makes it easy to organise my poetry into sections and to skim through all my work.
- Notes app is always available so it allows me to capture some of the more fleeting prose and poetry that comes while on
  the go. Other than that I don't use it for writing.

  ## Select one work from each volume of the Electronic Literature Collection
Volume 1:
Cruising
- What makes this piece digital literature?:
Cruising offers the reader more than just poetry, it offers interaction. To fully understand this piece the reader must zoom in and out, listen to audio, fast-forward and even go backwards to read this piece entirely. Thus, it transcends print literature.

- Personal response:
I enjoyed the simplicity of this piece, while acknowledging that for the time it was published (2006), it was ahead of its time. Now, looking back I feel it offered a view into the pioneering early 2000's digital writers. I enjoyed the photos that accompanied the poetry and the ability to zoom and go faster and slower. It had a real coming-of-age vibe to it.

Volume 2:
Entre Ville
- What makes this piece digital literature?:
Boasting a scroll-poem, interactable images that bring you to more poetry, more moments, this piece feels wide and full of love. It could not exist as print literature, as the theatre and beauty of it's interactable parts would be lost, causing the piece to feel less-than-whole.

- Personal Response:
I feel like I am in the place with her. Her each-to-her-own neighbour and the underwear dancing on the washing line, the man with an impending trumpet... It feels so alive. I love the imbedded email addresses, it brings the piece to the reader - so personal.

  ## Week 3 ~ Questions & Coding

**What elements of the works ("Taroko Gorge", "The Gathering Cloud", "First Draft of the Revolution", and "Shade") do you read?**

*Taroko Gorge*
- Taroko Gorge is (i think) an AI generated, never-ending poem. It presents as lines of poetry that move upwards, each new line
  pulling itself out of a green ether every second or so. Because it is text based and not interactable as far as I can tell, I
  would say all elements of this DW piece are readable, probably including the code (if i knew how to access it).


*The Gathering Cloud*
- The Gathering Cloud (from my interpretation) is a visual and written poetry piece about climate change and the online world.
  It has elements of readable text within it, usually small poetry pieces that lay disconnected with one another on the webpage,
  which also contain hyperlinks that give you addition information and alternative meanings for words used in the poem. Each
  'section' of The Gathering Cloud holds a written name - '[Frontispiece.]' '[No. 1.]' '[No. 2.]' '[No. 3.]' '[No. 4.]'
  '[No. 5.]' and '[SOURCES]', and even some of the moving & static visuals have written components to them (e.g. '[Frontispiece.]').


*First Draft of the Revolution*
- This piece of DW is a letter-based interactive fiction piece, presenting itself as a bunch of letters sent between characters. Because
  it exists in this format, I would say that almost all aspects of this piece are readable. When given the option to alter a letter,
  the replacement appears as text in a popup piece of paper, headered by the not-so-subtle command 'Re-write this', followed by the
  proposed new text. At the top of the page are intactive arrows labelled 'Previous page' and 'Next page' - therefore also readable.
  Though there are a few visual elements to this piece, it purposefully dwells almost entirely in a written, readable world.

*Shade*
- Shade, also an interactive fiction piece, activates your imagination through providing zero visuals. It is entirely code and text,
  thus entirely readable. To interact, the reader must write into the story to push it forward. New aspects emerging the more you
  probe. Because of this, it relies heavily on text - replying back to your written probes with very vague but equally intriguing
  text-based answers. Additionally, the cheat sheet (a very heavily relied on element of this work) is also text based. Simply, it is
  a written cheat sheet. It shows possible and impossible text imputs and describes how they might impact on the reader's 'gameplay' or
  interaction. It is also totally readable.
  

**How are those elements meaningful?**

*Taroko Gorge*
- In my opinion, the meaning comes from the code. Its performance or poetic emergence comes from the code, thus the code takes centre
  stage (Memmott T, 2006). The poem itself is a little less impressive meaning-wise, due to it's randomised nature. However, when I
  first read it I was unaware that it was AI generated and I thought the poem was (on occassion) quite beautiful.

*The Gathering Cloud*
- Here, the written poetry is purposeful and thus where most of the meaning can be pulled. Also notable is the use of hyperlinks within
  the poetry, some containing defintions of the hyperlinked word that offers new or different interpretations of the poem, or ones that
  utilise code to pull up forever-altering images of sunsets or 'little cat feet'. All aspects add meaning that bring the DW piece to life.

*First Draft of the Revolution*
- The story's meaning emerges first from the original letters provided to the reader, and evolves as the reader adds to or takes away from
  the letter. Without the element of change being presented, the work would exist a lot flatter than *with* the added ability to manipulate
  the piece.

*Shade*
- Having the ability to talk to the piece allows the reader to deeper engage, as it forces exploration and allows the imagination take hold.
  Meaning comes from the lack of visual aids and the write-respond features of the AI.
  

**How are the works read differently from print literature?**

*Taroko Gorge*
- While it exists in an entirely written format, this piece would not function as print literature. The ascending, animated nature of the poem,
  it's never-ending flow and forever changing lines means there is a video-like element to it that cannot be translated onto paper.

*The Gathering cloud*
- Similarly, this piece has animated, moving elements to it's poetry. It's hyperlinks, moving pictures and ever-updating visuals would be rendered
  null and void on print, killing the life of the piece.

*First Draft of the Revolution*
- This piece is unable to be converted to print-lit as the reader would lose the ability to manipulate the letters to such an extent that you can
  in a digital space. The book would be absolutely enormous, causing the ease of the piece to be rendered dead.

*Shade*
- Similar to Taroko Gorge, the AI code element would cease to exist in print literature, meaning that the reader would not be able to progress the
  narrative. Converting this piece to print-lit would mean the work is unreadable, in a much more severe way than any of the other three.
  

**How is electronic literature different from print literature?**
- Electronic literature requires the works to exist within an entirely online space, whereas print literature can often move between the two.
- Electronic literature tends to utilise artistic elements like 3D space, AI generators, games and interfacing - those of which you can use either
  not at all or to a much lesser degree in print literature.

**What are the qualities of the works we might consider as qualities of electronic literature?**
- An inability to be put into print form.
- Hybridising the defintion of literature to span to games, code, animation, or all of the above as one.

# Week 5
Writing Hypertext Fiction -

**How is it different from fiction?**

I don't know if it is different from fiction, because fiction is the genre, and hypertext is a subheading to fiction. but i would say hypertext is different from regular fiction because it gives the reader more agency than usual. It allows for choice in the narrative where regular ficiton is just a set storyline.

**How is it different from games?**

Hypertext fiction can have game elements, but generally it is less interactive than 'games' as it's only interface is the hypertext function which allows you to 'choose your path'. 

**How do you plan fiction?**

I don't write fiction very often, but when i do, i find it easier to base it vaguely around a non-fictional exeperience i have experienced. I also tend to not plan stories, but if i were to, i would research similar stories - e.g. if i wrote a story about elves i would read other stories about elves. and i would research my story's setting (usually based somewhat in reality). Apart from this i am not sure how i would plan the rest of the story.

**How could you plan hypertext fiction?**

Have a tiny story and build it out from there. where are the branching moments? will there be multiple endings? if no, how will the storyline's reconverge? if yes, how many endings will you allow? What other elements would you like to include in the story, e.g. audio, video, game, photos etc.


**Create a Short Branching Fiction Story**

Write a short branching fiction story. It should be nine short paragraphs in length and each paragraph should link to or be linked from at least two others.

i was going to try and adapt a story i wrote in a short form fiction class into a hypertext fiction piece. this is the piece:

*The Dancing Planet*

They had to set a precedent. They had to quell the riots. My revelation had cost them their peace and that was unforgivable. 
They gathered their forces to hunt me down and were surprised when they found I was not hiding. I knew that there was no escaping this. From the second that I pushed ‘Release’ on the broadcast, I had sealed my fate. This was my burden to bear, for the good of the station, for the lives of everyone I love, and for Kelios. 

…

There is a bang on my cell door and the guards enter. They cuff me and lead me out of the hold. We pass over the Space Deck, through the Captain’s Quarters and into the Chief’s cabin. On the way I see nobody that I recognise, though admittedly I am only looking for Lucy. 
Arriving in the cabin, they sit me down in front of a wooden table covered with diagrams, documents and pictures. I can see the pictures are of Kelios. They are my pictures. The documents and diagrams are mine too.

…

“Go! Go girl go!” I cried out to Lucy. Her pirouette continued for three more spins – a personal best. “Woohoo!” I cheered as she fell to the floor, panting and giggling. 
“How many was that?” she grinned.
“Aw, I reckon about nine.”
“Wow!” She stood up and ran at me. I swooped her up above my head and spun her around.
“And that makes ten!”

…
I have been studying the planetary gas giant, Kelios, for five years now. Her clouds of liquid uranium and pure diamond core are of great interest to the Chief – as harvesting them will surely pull our station out of poverty. It is my job as head of Celestial Research to determine the success rate of such a mission. So far, the facts aren’t promising.
The Chief has asked me to report on this next week. 

…

“All rise for Chief Palarm,” says the guard to my left. Palarm enters the room and everyone salutes. I do not. He walks straight up to the table and begins sifting through the papers. He pulls one out and places it in front of me; it is a photo of my wife and Lucy from two years ago, on Christmas Eve. Their smiles are wide and gentle. I wince. Palarm observes this but says nothing.

…

“My fellow inhabitants of Station 9. I have urgent and damning news to share with you. Chief Palarm has authorised the deployment of our remaining three Weapons of Last Resort, to be aimed and fired at Kelios’ core. This, if it is to go ahead, would not only destroy Kelios, but the force of the explosion would likely throw our station out of orbit and into Kelios’ deteriorating atmosphere. An atmosphere of nuclear radiation, liquid uranium rain, 1134-degree heat and crushing pressure. In other words, we will die if this mission is not prevented. My fellow citizens, our Chief’s greed must not prevail. It is time to protect our home. To protect Kelios. To protect each other. It is time to fight.”

…

“It’s okay, my love. Don’t cry. You’ve got Mum, you’ll be okay.” Lucy looked at me with big, wet eyes. Desperation lingered around her like an aura, almost tangible.

“Dad…” her voice wobbled and trailed off. I kissed her on the forehead. The guards made a move to grab me, their patience running thin.

“Okay, I’ll come. Please, just wait one second.” They paused and I turned back to Lucy. I gently pried her little fingers off my arm and handed her over to her mum. Lucy gulped and began crying again. 

“I love you,” I whispered to her. “To Kelios and back.”
The guards pulled me away.

…

“Atticus Maximillian Johnson, you have been accused of treason. Treason against me, your station and your people. How do you plead?” 

“Guilty,” I say, flat-toned.

Palarm looks at me dead in the eyes. “Then I sentence you to death by Spacewalk.”

…

The ship began to leave my vision as I spun around, the matte grey hull disappearing, the blackness returning, then Kelios. She looked different to me now than when I was on Station 9. Younger, gentler. Her curls and twists of atmosphere dancing in her own light. Her rings a protective border, a second world, a spinning tutu. 

She was a dancing planet. As she spun, I spun. As she turned, I turned. As air left me, it fell into her. I fed her, in some small way. And now I will remain, suspended in this black abyss. Just out of reach, with only gases and bone left inside me. 

We are the same.

*Final Project - Initial Steps:*

I did my proposal presentation today, where I chose to do my final project on Bitsy. It is called 'The Final Year of Grief', and it aims to centre grief if the first year after experiencing a death of someone you love.

The first step I need to take is to re-learn photoshop, in order to import scenes into Bitsy, rather than doing it within Bitsy itself, as it allows for less intricacy of room designs. This is harder than I originally thought it would be, and it is obvious that I am doing something wrong because my rooms keep looking like this in photoshop:

![new years1](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/65089dc2-89d0-414b-a710-712776c8db4a)

and this when I put it through pixsy (the site used to import scenes into Bitsy), and then into Bitsy:

![newyearsinbitsy](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/4db79236-a662-40d4-9bdc-c56da75586e2)

I don't know how to fix this... But I thought I had better keep coming up with scene ideas just incase it is fixable:



And before I did my presentation, when I was brainstorming what my major project would be, i designed a few other rooms.

If I make a room inspired by 'Under A Star Called Sun', this is what it might look like:

![room 1](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/23eb3d70-c402-4402-8d98-6633c1bee609)

Here is a base idea I came up with for my 'Autumn' room prior to my presentation:

![autumnbitsy](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/a0164206-377c-4931-b482-bb3e074a29e1)

Or

I will continue to experiment.

# Week 9

I didn't do any image scaling for Twine as my project uses Bitsy.

*Final Project - I figured it out:*

I asked Lara for help because I could not for the life of me understand what I was doing wrong where the quality of the photoshop scenes was so greatly decreased when put into pixsy and then Bitsy. Lara fixed it for me immediately, (thank you Lara) which made me feel very silly. But who cares, we can now progress.

I am now spending the class making new rooms because it actually feels fun now that it works properly!

This is my first draft of a spring room:

![pottingroom](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/ccc45a87-4382-4dab-97ee-78b49c42ce53)

The spring room (if i use this scene) will have animations of: 
1. dripping water from the watering can.
2. swaying vines coming off the tree.
3. maybe grass growing or flowers sprouting in the garden outside.
4. the sprout in the pot growing upwards.


# Week 10

Create a simple website:

*Final Project - Making Moves:*

I continued to make first drafts of rooms. This week I focus on winter:

![winter room 1](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/d1d56dd4-6552-41d1-a207-46bc8259ec71)


I workshopped this room and my spring one with my best friend, who has no idea what the hell I am doing. He is the least arty minded person I know, so I figured if I could make sure he knew what was going on in the rooms then it would be pretty likely that everyone else will know as well.

His main feedback was:

*Winter Room:* 
1. he couldn't tell that the rug on the floor was a rug, he thought the floor was the end of a bed and the rug was a quilt on it.
2. he thought the cushion on the window seat was a clock.

To fix this I asked if having a clear exit door on the floor like on the left bottom of the Spring Room would help make the floor look more like a floor and less like the end of a bed. He said yes, probably.

I don't know how to fix the cushion looking like a clock at this point in time but i will bear it in mind.

Here is my second draft of the winter room after fixing things based off my best friend's comments:

![winterroom](https://github.com/LydiaAbest/Folio/assets/163696192/cb8628a9-1ee9-45b5-bb8d-c2bf82af95ff)


*Spring Room:*
1. he thought it was a kitchen and was confused why there were tools hanging up in a kitchen.
2. he thought the pot with a sprout in it was a sink.
3. he thought the watering-can was a kettle.

To fix this I asked if whether having drips dropping from the watering-can's spout would make it feel more like a watering-can. To which he said yes.
Similarly, I asked if having animations of the sprout in the pot growing up would help it look less like a sink. He said yes definitely.


# Week 11

Today we are spending a lot of time on our projects in class. This is helpful, but also I am still only designing rooms and writing the poetry for each room so I don't have many questions to ask Benjamin, which is unfortunate. I know as soon as he is not available I will have tonnes of questions.

*Final Project - Poetry Writing:*

As I mentioned before, I am beginning to write the poetry for each season-based room. So far I have written a first draft for my summer room (even though I don't have a room design for it yet). I am using this poetry writing as an excuse to journal for the first time in my life because I think it's the best way to illustrate my thought processes for this folio. Here is my journal page for summer:

[insert photo of journal page here]

My writing is pretty messy so I'll type out the poetry again here just incase you can't read it:

-

*Summer stretches its golden paws*

*Across my windowsill.*

*Warm cat of life.*


*I approach it fast and uncaring.*

*Pull the venetian blinds closed,*

*There is no place here for life.*


*I return to my bed, to rot in the damp*

*Coffin of darkness.*

*I need to feel close to you.*

-

My initial quick edit of this piece is:

-

*Summer stretches its golden paws*

*Across my windowsill.*

*Warm cat of life.*


*I approach it fast and uncaring,*

*Pulling the venetian blinds shut with a clack.*

*The noise scares the cat away,*

*And I retreat to my bed, to rot*

*In the damp coffin of darkness.*


*There is no place here for life.*

*I just need to feel close to you.*
